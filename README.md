This repository contains a script to get a tidy data set with a summary of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, a database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
The file is available at this link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

The script will do the following tasks:

Set a new repository
Download the file from UCI archive
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

the output of the script is the tidy_dataset.txt dataset
